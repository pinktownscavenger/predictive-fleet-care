# predictive-fleet-care
The goal of this project is to predict maintenance needs for trucks using machine learning. By leveraging historical data, we aim to reduce unplanned downtimes and improve operational efficiency.

## Project Overview

Preprocessing:
* Removing irrelevant and low-variance features.
  * Using mutual information and correlation analysis to identify and drop redundant features.
* Machine Learning Models:
  * Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
* Performance Metrics:
  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and a visualized Confusion Matrix.
