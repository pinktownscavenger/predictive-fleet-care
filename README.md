# Predictive Fleet Care
The goal is to predict maintenance needs for trucks using ML techniques and historical data, aiming to reduce unplanned downtimes and improve operational efficiency.

## Project Overview
1. Removing irrelevant and low-variance features.
  * Using mutual information and correlation analysis to identify and drop redundant features.
2. Machine Learning Models:
  * Comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
3. Performance Metrics:
  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and a visualized Confusion Matrix.
